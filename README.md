Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application built with React, designed to visualize pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's, DFS, BFS, and A*. Users can generate various mazes, such as Recursive Division, Prim's, Kruskal's, and a random maze, allowing algorithms to find the shortest path through different grid configurations. Users may also clear the path, reset the board, or create custom walls to experiement with how each algorithm behaves.
